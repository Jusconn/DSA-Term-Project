Our project was the splay tree data structure. We created two splay tree classes under Initial Splay Tree and Splay Tree Implementation.

**Initial Splay Tree**
  The initial splay tree folder contains our basic implementation of a splay tree. Which behaves very similar to a binary search tree, except for its ability to perform "splays". Splays are a method of structuring the tree based on inserts,deletes and searches. What is special about splay trees is that searched items are splayed to the root of the tree, allowing for faster referencing to frequently used nodes. Our main file under the inital splay tree folder shows an example of this.
